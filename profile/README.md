### **Future-State CI/CD and Compliance Architecture: The Narrative Journey**

The journey begins at the **developer’s workspace**, where code evolves from concept to commit. Each engineer works within a standardized environment equipped with pre-approved templates, secure coding practices, and access control policies. Once the developer pushes code to the **central source control system**, an automated trigger sets the entire CI/CD ecosystem in motion.

---

#### **1. Continuous Integration and Quality Gates**

As code enters the pipeline, it passes through a **series of quality and compliance checkpoints**. Automated build jobs compile the application and run an extensive suite of **unit, integration, and security tests**.

From there, the build is scanned for **vulnerabilities and compliance violations** by integrated scanning engines—these may include static code analysis, dependency vulnerability scans, container image checks, and policy enforcement based on frameworks such as CIS, NIST, or SOC2.

Every scan result is aggregated into a **compliance and reporting layer**, which continuously benchmarks builds against enterprise standards. Failures automatically route alerts to both the development team and the compliance dashboard for remediation.

---

#### **2. Artifact Management and Promotion**

Once a build passes all checks, it’s packaged into versioned **artifacts** stored in a **central artifact repository** (e.g., a universal binary repository or container registry). Metadata, including hash values, test results, and compliance status, is attached for traceability.

Automated policies determine promotion across environments—**from dev to staging to production**—based on approval workflows, success thresholds, and deployment readiness indicators.

---

#### **3. Continuous Deployment and Environment Orchestration**

Deployment automation is orchestrated through **infrastructure-as-code** templates that define both compute and network resources. These templates are stored, versioned, and validated to ensure consistency and auditability across multiple cloud or hybrid environments.

The deployment process supports **blue-green, rolling, and canary strategies**, minimizing downtime and risk. Each deployment triggers **real-time observability hooks**, feeding performance and event data into a **centralized monitoring and logging platform**.

---

#### **4. Monitoring, Security, and Feedback Loops**

Post-deployment, multiple asynchronous systems engage simultaneously:

* **Monitoring and Alerting:** Metrics and logs stream into a unified observability layer, enabling proactive detection of performance degradation or anomalies.
* **Compliance and Security Posture Management:** Continuous monitoring tools (like Wiz, or its functional equivalent) assess cloud assets, containers, and workloads for drift, misconfiguration, and exposure.
* **FinOps and Cost Optimization:** Financial and resource data are analyzed in near real time to track spend, optimize utilization, and forecast budgets.
* **Reporting and Governance:** Results from compliance, performance, and financial systems converge into a **central governance dashboard**, offering a consolidated view for both technical and executive stakeholders.

---

#### **5. Continuous Improvement and Automation Feedback**

Insights from monitoring, compliance, and cost analytics automatically feed back into the development process. Engineers and operations teams use this intelligence to refine **pipeline automation**, **security policies**, and **resource allocation**.

Through this closed feedback loop, the organization achieves a **self-optimizing, compliant, and cost-aware CI/CD ecosystem**—one that is resilient, scalable, and aligned with evolving business objectives.

---

#### **Summary of Key Architectural Principles**

* **Cloud-Agnostic & Modular:** Each component—compute, storage, monitoring, and compliance—can operate across any major cloud or on-prem environment.
* **Shift-Left Security:** Scanning and compliance occur early and continuously.
* **Policy-Driven Automation:** Infrastructure and deployments are governed by declarative, version-controlled policies.
* **Continuous Feedback:** Observability, cost, and compliance data continuously inform development and operations.
* **Unified Visibility:** A single pane of glass integrates monitoring, compliance, and cost insights.

### Purpose Split

* `opa-policies-core` hosts OPA/Rego polices and tests (eg. enforcing required lables on cloud provider storage.
* `infra-gcp-platform` Owns Terraform code, planning, and CI/CD that applies infrastructure; it consumes the policies as a policy gate.

## Integration Point

- `infra-gcp-platform` produces a Terraform plan and converts it to JSON (`terraform show -json`).
- CI runs policy evaluation using Conftest or OPA against `opa-policies-core/policies`.
- Policies read `input.resource_changes` 
- If any `google_storage_bucket` is missing required labels (`environment`, `owner`), the build fails with clear messages.

Typical Lifecycle: 

- Policy authors evolve rules in `opa-polices-core` with opa test.
- Infra authors change Terraform
- CI in infra repo fetches/points to the policy bundle and gate merges/deploys.

Operational flow (CI/CD)

1. Developer pushes Terraform changes to `infra-gcp-platform
2. CI runs: terraform init, terraform plan, terraform show
3. CI runs policy check: conftest or opa eval
4. If violations exist, CI fails with actionable messages; otherwise proceeds to apply.

## Data/contract between repos
* Input document: Terraform plan JSON containing `resource_changes` entries.
* Policy package: gcp.labels
* Entry points: data.gcp.labels.allow (boolean), data.gcp.labels.deny (collection of violation messages)
* Current enforced rule(s)
